**Resume Classification**

Sorting through hundreds of resumes is tedious work. Different formats, unique writing styles, and industry jargon make manual screening a nightmare for recruiters.

In this project, we explored how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning can automate this process. Our goal was to build a system that reads a raw resume and automatically categorizes it into the correct job role (e.g., Engineering, HR, Sales, Information Technology).

We didn't just stick to one method; we pitted four different machine learning models against each other to see which one was the "King of Classification."


📊 The Data

We used a dataset sourced from Kaggle, **Resume.csv**, containing over 2,400 resumes originally scraped from LiveCareer.com.

Cleaning: To ensure our models learned meaningful patterns, we filtered the data to only include job categories that had at least 100 samples. This helped prevent class imbalance issues.
